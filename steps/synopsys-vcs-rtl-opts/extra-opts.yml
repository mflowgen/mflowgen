# Initialize uninitialized registers
#
# This can be set to random, ones, or zeroes (only for registers, not
# memories). Note that this option masks X's on initialization and
# provides just one specific initial condition, which may no longer be
# reflective of what will happen in real hardware. While it is okay to use
# this option to debug, it is safer to have it off before tapeout.
