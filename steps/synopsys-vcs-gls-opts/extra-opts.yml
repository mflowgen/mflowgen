# Performance options for GLS simulation

- -hsopt=gates

# Initialize uninitialized registers
#
# This can be set to random, ones, or zeroes (only for registers, not
# memories). Note that this option masks X's on initialization and
# provides just one specific initial condition, which may no longer be
# reflective of what will happen in real hardware. While it is okay to use
# this option to debug, it is safer to have it off before tapeout.

# Enable SDF annotation
#
# The -sdf option needs to know the path to the design under test as a dot
# path (e.g., "top.dut") that will be sdf annotated. This is left as a
# parameter that must be available when this option is parsed at build
# time. Right now it is just a string.

# IMPORTANT -- Please SDF annotate in testbench
#
# Although it is possible to do SDF annotation with the -sdf option on the
# command line, it is better practice to use $sdf_annotate directly in
# your testbench for better control over which module you are annotating.
#
# Note that this also means that SDF annotation happens at sim time and
# not at compile time.
#
# Please do it similar to this:
#
#     `ifdef VCS_GLS_SDF
#     initial begin
#       $sdf_annotate( "inputs/design.sdf", top.dut, , sdfannotate.log );
#     end
#     `endif
#
